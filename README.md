## Description 

This project takes questions from user input using the inquirer package in node. The important take-away of this assignment is that it creates different objects that have slightly different data, which can be reused over and over. This data gest pushed to an HTML with all the information provided by the user. 

Each employee type has their own constructor information that extends from the Employee constructor function. The purpose of keeping all objects separate is so they can be used as templates and called upon as needed based on how many interns or engineers the user needs to add to the HTML. 

Overall, the user of this code can quickly create an employee summary easily after answering some questions, and keeping constructor functions and classes separate allow for easy reuse of objects and create as many employee positions as they need.
